Hello there!

This is just an example repository which I was working with during the 'Good Software Practices Workshop' at TU Delft. 

Organized by: NL EScience Center and TU Delft
Date: 18th-19th March, 2025
Venue: TU Delft Library


The objective here was to practice examples on collaborating with Git using Issues and Pull Requests. An additional excersice trying to create and resolve a merge conflict was also done. You can refer to the commit log for more information.

Thank you!
Tarun Hegde
